# sdl2-TicTacToe
The simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created in C++ with SDL2.

This game was developed for learning purposes.
The current only supported mode is single player and the bot you'll be facing adjust its AI level (easy, medium or hard) at every new game.
All board shapes were drwan using hardware accelerated primitive rendering, so no image resources were needed in the project.
